# Discsweeper, a script for making minesweeper for discord spoiler tags

Go have fun :)

## Instructions

Make a file with a bunch of characters using `b` for bombs. Run the following:

```shell
$ python3 discsweeper.py file.txt
```

It will generate a `_plain` file that's easier to look at, and a `_disc` file  for pasting.
